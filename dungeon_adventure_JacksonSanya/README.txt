Jackson and Sanya's Dungeon Adventure

- what work each person did

Jackson:
-> adventurer, items, rooms classes, documentation for each of these classes
-> classes all work
  ex: if you call update health with a pit trap, health is taken away. Same for updating with a health potion. 
  ex: you are able to add/ remove and update potions, pillars in the adventurer backpack.
-> helped with parts of Dungeon Class and some of Dungeon Adventure
-> organization of project
  note: the items class is a subsect of the rooms class. It holds all the consumables that are available in rooms, thought this was best as the items can also be used in the adventurer class.

Sanya:
-> Dungeon Class
-> Dungeon Adventure 
-> documentation for both of those classes
-> UML Diagram


- estimate of time spent on project

Jackson: IDK maybe 80+ hours

Sanya: approximately 95 hours 

- extra credit attempted: 
-> Sanya: made PNG of the health & vision potions
-> Jackson: had working GUI with background music / learned the pygame module

N/A

- any shortcomings the project has
-> vision potion wont work because the dungeon wasn't done in time so we couldn't map it
-> didn't have time for unit tests because we couldnt get dungeon to work
-> can't move adventurer around the dungeon essentially making the game unplayable

- any other information you might think is useful for grading
-> everything works independently, we just couldnt get things connected in time. 
-> there are only two of us in our group. We didn't have the extra hand that other teams did. 
-> reached out to TA for assistance when there was some confusion on Dungeon class
