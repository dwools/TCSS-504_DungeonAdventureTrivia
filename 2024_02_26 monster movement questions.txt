Why are monsters getting stuck in the walls?

1. Are they moving along the maze floor? Or are they following the shortest "as the crow flies" route and moving diagonally? 
	Monsters appear to move over the maze diagonally. 

2. Why are position values being set to non-floor spaces? How can we preclude this? 

	The pathfinder algorithm lays down a red line that doesn't cross through walls. Why 	is the monster not following this? How can we get the monster to follow the red 		line more strictly? 


3. Why/how are monsters allowed to occupy walled-off spaces in the first place? What
	Edit the set_position method to see if the new position is going to be in a wall, and if not, find a new position(?)
