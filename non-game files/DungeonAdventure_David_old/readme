Time it took each person to work on assignment...
- Andrew Innes: 30 hours
- Aubree Payne: 21 hours
- David Woolston: 50

What each person worked on...
- Andrew Innes: Created DungeonAdventure and related tests, DungeonASCII, and created a couple helper methods within dungeon,
  Room, and Adventurer
- Aubree Payne: Uploaded assignment breakdown to GitHub, created code for Adventurer class, Room Class, and HealthPotion class, 
  and started the draft for UML diagram.
- David Woolston: Created Dungeon class, DungeonFactory class, and related tests. Created a few drawing methods inside Room.

Any shortcomings/concerns the project has:
- Aubree Payne: Because there were so many variations on how to do this assignment it was a bit difficult to get help.
- Andrew Innes: Code could have been more modular and efficient in places. Coordination and dependencies posed some challenges at times.
- David Woolston: The maze does not randomize the locations of entrance and exit. Accessing a list of content on a per-room basis is difficult. The game does not monitor player's location in the maze. Maze generation slows significantly when door probability is <50%, despite implementing an imporoved traversal strategy.

Any other information you might think is useful for grading:
- Extra Credit: Created difficulty option at the beginning
- Extra Credit: Creative game loop and exit handling methods
- Typing ADVENTURE will show the full map at any time
